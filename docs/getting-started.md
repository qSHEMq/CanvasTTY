# Getting started

[English](getting-started.md) · [Русский](getting-started.ru.md) · [简体中文](getting-started.zh-CN.md) · [Docs home](README.md)

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm.
- A native compiler toolchain supported by `node-pty` on your platform.
- A graphical desktop session capable of running Electron.
- Optional agent CLIs — `codex`, `claude`, `qwen`, `kimi`, `opencode`, `hermes`, `grok`, `omp`, or `pi` — installed and available in `PATH` for the launchers you intend to use.

CanvasTTY does not install or authenticate agent CLIs for you. Complete each provider's own login flow before expecting its sessions or subscription limits to work.

## Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm install` also prepares Electron and rebuilds the native `node-pty` module. The development command starts the real Electron application, not a browser-only mock.

Packaged builds update from the row in **Settings → General**. That row reports one state at a time: the installed version when idle, a check in progress, **Update available** with the new version, **Downloading update** with a percent when the feed reports one, and **Update ready** with **Install and restart** once the download has finished. Downloading and installing are separate explicit actions, so **Install and restart** appears only after the download. A development build reports updates as unavailable instead of failing.

## First session

1. Open **Terminal** on Home to start a shell immediately in the last project directory.
2. Open **Codex**, **Claude**, **Kimi**, **OpenCode**, **Hermes**, **Grok Build**, **OMP**, or **Pi** to choose a project folder and launch profile for that fixed provider.
3. Open **Browser** on Home to create or restore the built-in browser card. Agent sessions launched by CanvasTTY can use its open tabs while **Settings → Browser → Agent access** is enabled.
4. Move or resize the live terminal and browser on the same canvas.
5. Zoom out to use semantic summaries as navigation targets; zoom back in to interact with xterm or the native browser page.
6. Return to Home to inspect real sessions, connected browser agents, and any provider quota windows that their adapters expose.

The **YOLO** profile disables provider safety prompts where the provider supports such a mode. For OpenCode, CanvasTTY applies a launch-only inline `permission: "allow"` override while preserving the rest of the merged OpenCode configuration. Hermes receives its native `--yolo` flag, while Grok Build receives its native `--always-approve` flag for that launch. OMP receives its native `--auto-approve` flag and Pi receives `--approve`; Pi has no permission system, so its only prompt is project trust, which is why its flag differs in kind from the others. CanvasTTY presents an explicit danger confirmation; use it only in a directory you are willing to let the agent modify.

## Terminal input and controls

- Press any live terminal card to select and focus it. Input focus is independent from selection, so future multi-selection can keep one unambiguous keyboard and wheel target.
- Click outside every widget to clear input focus. Clicking a decorative or action-only widget does not make it the wheel target.
- **Settings → Controls → Focus on hover** moves input focus after the pointer rests on a focusable widget for slow `500ms`, normal `250ms`, or fast `80ms`. Leaving only cancels a pending transfer; assigned focus remains and selection is unchanged. It is off by default.
- On a fresh profile, ordinary scroll over canvas, unfocused widgets, and non-focusable widgets pans on both axes; pinch and `Cmd/Ctrl + scroll` zoom around the pointer. A focused input widget keeps plain wheel/pinch in Off or released-Key mode. This includes a live Browser page, so it scrolls natively while focused; an unfocused Browser, On, an active Key binding, pinch, and `Cmd/Ctrl + scroll` route to the canvas. Browser summary/placeholder surfaces always route to the canvas. **Settings → Controls → Use scroll wheel to zoom** restores ordinary wheel zoom. Fresh profiles use Key with `Command` on macOS or `Ctrl` elsewhere. The separate full canvas navigation override defaults to `Option` on macOS and `Alt` elsewhere, accepts standalone Command/Ctrl, captures drag as well as wheel/pinch, and shows the hand cursor while held.
- Terminal scrolling and canvas navigation have independent wheel-direction settings. Canvas inversion applies to both pan axes and to ordinary wheel zoom.
- `Shift+Enter` sends a modified Enter sequence to insert a line break in compatible agent prompts without submitting. `Enter` keeps its normal PTY behavior.
- With terminal text selected, `Ctrl+C`/`Ctrl+Shift+C` or `Cmd+C` copies it. Paste with `Ctrl+Shift+V`, `Cmd+V`, or `Shift+Insert`. Plain `Ctrl+C` without a selection remains the PTY interrupt.
- With a terminal card focused, `Ctrl+Shift+F` opens the card's scrollback search row: input, match counter, previous/next, and close. `Enter` moves to the next match, `Shift+Enter` to the previous, and `Escape` closes the row and returns focus to the terminal, so keystrokes never leak into the PTY. The row is unavailable in semantic summary mode.
- `Alt+ArrowUp`/`Alt+ArrowDown`/`Alt+ArrowLeft`/`Alt+ArrowRight` (`Option` on macOS) moves focus to the nearest window in that direction across terminal cards, the built-in browser, and plugin canvases. A candidate must be strictly ahead in that direction, and ties break on perpendicular distance. The gesture is inert while renaming a window or capturing a shortcut, and it leaves `Ctrl+K` and `Ctrl+,` untouched.
- `Shift`+drag on empty canvas draws a marquee and selects every terminal card it intersects (plugin canvases, the built-in browser, and sticky notes are not tested); dragging any selected terminal then moves the whole selection by the same delta. A press that does not travel stays a plain click. Marquee is additive to the existing pointer navigation, so plain empty-canvas drag still pans as before.
- **Fit to content**, next to the canvas Home and zoom buttons, frames the HOME zone and every window with a margin, clamped to the canvas zoom range of `0.2x`–`1.35x`; on an empty canvas it goes HOME. The same command is offered in the canvas palette. There is no keyboard chord for it.

## Browser controls and activity

- The browser follows the same independent selection and input-focus rules as terminal cards. Native page hover transfers focus after the configured delay; leaving the page does not clear it. In Off or released-Key mode, that focus also lets plain wheel scroll the live page. Pinch and `Cmd/Ctrl + scroll` still zoom the canvas. A page can also scroll through scrollbar drag, keyboard input, or site controls.
- Use the trusted tab strip and navigation bar for HTTP(S) pages. Hiding the card preserves tabs; **Close all** removes them after confirmation.
- **Settings → Browser** controls agent access and tab restore and shows recent downloads and command activity.
- **Clear browser data** removes tabs, site data, cache, auth cache, staged uploads, and the current download list. It deliberately keeps the persistent redacted audit log.
- The audit log lives below Electron `userData/browser/audit`, rotates at 100 MB, and prunes rotated files older than 30 days during store initialization or rotation. Read [Built-in browser and audit log](browser.md) before handling or deleting it.

## Useful commands

| Command | Purpose |
|:--|:--|
| `npm run dev` | Start the Electron development build |
| `npm test` | Run the Node test suite |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check main/preload and renderer projects |
| `npm run build` | Type-check and create the production bundles |
| `npm run preview` | Launch the built application for a production-path check |

Before handing off a change, run the test, typecheck, and build commands, then inspect the affected flow in a real Electron window.

## Where local state lives

Settings are validated and persisted by the main-process `SettingsStore`. Live terminal state and bounded scrollback belong to `TerminalManager`; the renderer is not the source of truth for PTY history. Browser site data stays in its persistent Chromium partition, safe tab restore state stays in `userData/browser-state.json`, and the redacted hash-chain audit stays below `userData/browser/audit`. Provider credentials stay with the installed CLIs and trusted main-process adapters and are never returned over IPC.

For the exact boundaries, read [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md). For interaction and visual rules, read the [UI contract](UI_CONTRACT.md).

## Troubleshooting

### `node-pty` fails to build

Install the compiler, Python, and platform headers required by your operating system, then rerun `npm install`. Do not replace the native PTY with a fake terminal: real local processes are a core product constraint.

### A provider launches but limits are unavailable

A working CLI session and a readable subscription-quota API are separate capabilities. Re-authenticate the CLI, then inspect the explicit reason exposed by CanvasTTY. Some account types do not provide a subscription window; the UI must show unavailable rather than `0%`.

### A terminal exists but is not marked working

CanvasTTY shows live `idle`/`working`/`needs_approval` for Codex, Claude Code, Qwen Code, Kimi Code, OpenCode, Hermes, and Grok Build from provider lifecycle hooks. An agent stays `unavailable` until its first machine-readable signal; terminal text and PTY existence are not activity telemetry. OMP and Pi report no lifecycle events at all, so their cards show **Status unavailable** for the whole session. That is expected behaviour, not a fault, and no status will arrive later.
