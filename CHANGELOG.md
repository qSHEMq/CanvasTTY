[English](CHANGELOG.md) · [Русский](CHANGELOG.ru.md) · [简体中文](CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md)

## Unreleased

- Denied browser and device permissions on the default session: permission requests, permission checks, and device handlers now refuse, so plugin windows and shells cannot obtain camera, microphone, geolocation, or notification access. The built-in browser keeps its own separate partition policy.
- Hardened packaged builds with Electron fuses that disable the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable and CLI inspect arguments and enable embedded asar integrity validation. `runAsNode` stays enabled on purpose because provider CLIs and the agent runtime spawn the bundled helpers through `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`; cookie encryption is not enabled because that transition is one-way.
- Added renderer crash recovery: if the renderer process is lost, the main process logs the reason and exit code and reloads the application surface instead of leaving a blank window, while terminal services and live sessions keep running across the recovery. Losing a utility or GPU child is logged.
- Added scrollback search: `Ctrl+Shift+F` in a focused terminal card opens an in-card search row with the input, match counter, previous/next, and close. `Enter` moves to the next match, `Shift+Enter` to the previous, and `Escape` closes the row and returns focus to the terminal so keystrokes never leak into the PTY. The row stays hidden in semantic summary mode.
- Cards now show the title the provider sets through OSC 0/2 while their title is not user-customized, falling back to the existing path display when the provider sets none. Renaming wins permanently, and the provider title is display-only: it is never written back and never persisted.
- Added a “Fit to content” canvas control that frames the HOME zone and every window with a margin inside the existing `0.2–1.35` zoom range; an empty canvas goes HOME instead. It is also offered in the canvas palette, and there is no keyboard chord for it.
- Added directional focus: `Alt+ArrowUp/Down/Left/Right` (`Option` on macOS) moves focus to the nearest window in that direction across terminal cards, the built-in browser, and plugin canvases, requiring the target to be strictly ahead with a perpendicular-distance tie-break. The gesture does not run while renaming or capturing a shortcut, and leaves `Ctrl+K` and `Ctrl+,` untouched.
- Added marquee selection: `Shift+drag` on empty canvas selects every terminal card it intersects (plugin canvases, the built-in browser, and sticky notes are not tested), and dragging any selected terminal moves the whole selection by the same delta, while a press that does not travel stays a plain click. Plain empty-canvas drag still pans the canvas exactly as before.
- Added the session path to canvas palette search alongside the label and provider, so a session entry is found by its working directory. No second palette and no new key binding.
- Added browser inspect to agent: the browser card's Inspect control observes up to 20 elements through the existing browser command path and lists all of them by role/name with an element reference, so every observed element is reachable. “Send to agent” writes exactly one structured line, terminated with a carriage return, into the newest running agent session; a stale reference (changed tab or document revision) fails visibly instead of sending a wrong element, and with no running agent session the panel says so and sends nothing. A session awaiting a decision is never the send target, the page URL sent carries no credentials, query string or fragment, and page-supplied text is marked as untrusted in the line.
- Added a HOME attention queue of sessions that need approval or have failed, derived only from session snapshots, always rendering its title row and an explicit empty state; clicking a row focuses that session. Failure details (trigger, popover, copy) were extracted into one shared implementation used by both the queue and the existing session rows.
- Added an attention ring on cards whose session needs approval or has failed, plus the “Notify when attention is needed” setting in Settings → General (on by default) that raises one OS notification on a genuine transition into needing approval or failing: repeated snapshots and already-seen restore-time failures stay silent, and a failure the user triggers by restarting also notifies. Toggling the setting persists.
- Cards now report whether they render live output: those in semantic summary mode (zoom below 0.5) stop receiving streamed output while their scrollback stays canonical and complete within the bounded history, and the missed output is replayed once when the card becomes visible again; if more output was produced while hidden than the bounded history holds, the oldest part of that stretch is gone and the replay says so instead of pretending the output is continuous.
- Limited WebGL to the focused terminal card: one context at a time, disposed when focus leaves, with a fallback to the DOM renderer when the context is lost. Palette and transparency rendering are unchanged.
- Added a self-update row in Settings → General with the honest states: idle, checking, update available with the version, downloading with the percent when known, ready to install, and unavailable for dev, offline, or error. Downloading and installing are explicit user actions, install-and-restart is offered only once the update is downloaded, and in development the row reports unavailable instead of throwing.
- Hardened the repository secret audit to ignore key prefixes embedded inside identifiers, so names such as `disk-…` or `task-…` no longer produce false positives while real keys still match.

## 1.5.1

- Fixed the HOME Terminal button passing a mouse event as canvas coordinates and failing with “Session position is invalid”.
- Added local file drag-and-drop into terminal cards. File paths are quoted for the host's default shell and pasted without submitting the command; filenames with spaces and Unicode are preserved.
- Fixed terminal history replay overlapping live output, scrollbar coordinates at canvas zoom, and scrollback/follow-output position during resize.
- Added the configurable radial quick launcher from PR #29. It is off by default and can be enabled under Settings → Agents → Quick launcher without losing the selected actions when disabled.
- Added a close button that deletes sticky notes (PR #30).
- Added project-path paste in agent launch dialogs and corrected GNOME clipboard metadata handling (PRs #27 and #31). Terminal links now offer a choice between the built-in and system browser (PR #28).
- Restored Claude Code usage tracking with credential-store selection fixes (PR #25).

## 1.5.0

- Replaced competing canvas right-click handlers with one context-sensitive dispatcher. Empty canvas, color regions, and sticky notes now expose their own actions; the configurable safe agent/terminal launcher is shared with the searchable `Cmd/Ctrl+K` command palette.
- Added sticky notes as first-class persistent canvas windows with editing, drag, eight-direction resize, snapping, deletion, deterministic region containment, and minimap markers. This work adapts and credits the original sticky-note and quick-launcher ideas from @TroopJostle's PR #23.
- Finished color-region movement: completely contained terminals, Browser/plugin windows, and notes follow continuously during region drag and persist once at release. Region targeting, magnetic snapping, and bounds rules no longer attach partially overlapping windows or teleport them after the gesture.
- Added ordinary click-to-front stacking for every canvas window. The native Browser surface now respects renderer-owned overlap, and launch dialogs are clamped before their first frame instead of flashing outside the application near the right edge.
- Redesigned Settings and all canvas menus around shared application tokens, official Lucide/provider assets, and one `0.85–1.25` UI-chrome scale. Palette changes recolor menus automatically without changing canvas zoom or terminal font size.
- Added independent General settings for saving color regions and sticky notes after exit. Disabling either keeps its live objects for the current run while omitting only that collection from the next-launch snapshot.
- Split minimap interaction into explicit Click and Drag modes. Drag now follows empty-canvas grab direction without an initial camera jump, while a stationary press in Drag mode performs no click navigation.

## 1.3.0

- Added opt-in terminal-window restoration. CanvasTTY persists only window identity, provider/profile, title, project folder, position, and size; agents resume through their native project-scoped continue mode, while PTY scrollback and capabilities remain ephemeral.
- Added named pastel Canvas regions from the empty-canvas context menu, plus an RTS-style camera-centred minimap. HOME and fixed-size window markers now move through a uniform projection without auto-fit distortion, and a HOME edge marker appears only after HOME has fully left the radar.
- Expanded Canvas navigation bindings to Mouse3/Mouse4/Mouse5, kept middle-button drag as the direct pan fallback, and corrected wheel ownership so terminal session lists and focused input surfaces scroll locally while explicit Canvas capture remains predictable.
- Fixed Grok Build's cropped initial TUI by waiting for the renderer-measured xterm grid on launch, restart, and restore. Terminal resize and palette changes preserve the active scrollback viewport.
- Added configurable whole-row agent status colors in Appearance: gray for idle/unavailable/finished states, sage green for working, and yellow for input-needed, with a monochrome alternative.
- Fixed Claude usage limits to read the current runtime user's OAuth credentials and perform the provider request when a token exists. Missing local credentials now mean sign-in is required instead of being misreported as a missing subscription.
- Prevented CanvasTTY from restoring, showing, or focusing its window because of a rejected second launch or background plugin/browser activity, avoiding unsolicited virtual-desktop switches.
- Added a concise Agents hook switch, expandable About FAQ, and explicit per-hook trust for optional plugin agent hooks. Plugin hooks remain disabled after install/update and run in an isolated process with CanvasTTY internal capabilities stripped.

## 1.2.8

- Added Qwen Code as a first-class launcher across HOME, Settings, CLI discovery, Normal/YOLO profiles, the plugin SDK, and the scoped built-in-browser MCP bridge, using the official Qwen mark and launch-only configuration.
- Added a Qwen row to HOME limit display and its settings. Because Qwen Code can use unrelated cloud or local model providers and exposes no universal quota-read protocol, CanvasTTY reports an explicit unavailable reason instead of inventing usage data.
- Replaced the generic open state for agent sessions with an authenticated local lifecycle gateway. Codex, Claude Code, Qwen Code, Kimi Code, OpenCode, Hermes, and Grok Build now report idle, working, and input-needed through provider hooks without forwarding prompt or response content; Claude/Qwen terminal-title markers remain a compatibility fallback.
- Fixed delayed bootstrap snapshots reverting an already observed agent lifecycle back to unavailable. Session metadata now carries a main-owned monotonic revision, and the renderer rejects stale status updates while preserving initial terminal output.
- Preserved the active terminal scrollback position when a card or application window is resized instead of jumping to the beginning of the session.
- Kept segmented-setting keyboard focus inside its selected button and restored spacing between the wheel/pinch capture selector and its conditional key editor.

## 1.2.7

- Added a permission-gated Hermes Desktop HUD bridge for plugins. The host exposes only status, open-in-HUD, and close operations through `hermes:hud`; plugins cannot choose an executable, arguments, or PID.

## 1.2.6

- Provider CLI executables are now resolved once at startup and reused by terminals, usage limits, and agent-browser flows through the same absolute launcher, with structured diagnostics for missing and non-executable commands.
- Failed HOME sessions now expose complete sanitized diagnostics on hover or keyboard focus, offer a Copy action, and explain silent exits with their exit code. The top-layer details popover preserves the three-row scroll viewport and the failed-session danger rail.
- Packaged macOS apps now discover Homebrew CLIs and the official per-user OpenCode install under `~/.opencode/bin` even when launched with Finder's minimal `PATH`.
- CI now packages the macOS app and exercises real minimal-`PATH` CLI resolution on every pull request and `main` update, in addition to the release-time smoke.

## 1.2.5

- Added OpenCode, Hermes, and Grok Build as first-class launchers on Linux, macOS, and Windows, with official provider marks, native per-launch YOLO behavior, Windows discovery, plugin SDK coverage, and scoped built-in browser MCP integration where supported.
- Added an independent **Agents** settings section: launcher visibility and HOME limit visibility are persisted separately, hidden launchers leave existing sessions untouched, and the HOME dock automatically redistributes visible buttons.
- Added source-backed OpenCode Go and Grok Build usage adapters alongside Codex, Claude, and Kimi. The five-row HOME limits tile now switches to compact, height-aware geometry so every countdown and usage rail stays inside its default bounds.
- Expanded Appearance with independent HOME accent presets/custom colors and Canvas background colors, plus diagonal and ring patterns. Canvas colors no longer recolor HOME widgets, and the Settings top strip remains visually separated from scrolling content.
- Fixed native Browser viewport clipping so embedded pages stay inside the usable workspace instead of covering application chrome, and added visible DEV/release build identity with normalized provider marks.

## 1.2.4

- macOS bundles are now explicitly ad-hoc signed with hardened runtime and notarization disabled for the free distribution path; the release workflow runs strict `codesign` verification before uploading artifacts.
- Updated installation guidance to explain that ad-hoc signing verifies bundle integrity but does not provide a Developer ID or notarization. macOS users should replace the pre-fix `1.2.2` and `1.2.3` artifacts with `1.2.4` or later.

## 1.2.3

- Added a GitHub-backed plugin showcase with complete pagination, metadata-first manifests, platform and host-version hints, update discovery, and OAuth Device Flow sign-in.
- Hardened plugin installation and updates with platform enforcement, atomic rollback, strict manifest validation, bounded metadata batches, trusted archive redirects, and protected OAuth persistence and IPC.
- Added the permission-gated plugin `browser.open` SDK method for normalized HTTP(S) URLs, routed through one awaitable broker that creates or reuses a single embedded Browser card and persists it before reporting success.

## 1.2.2

- Reworked canvas navigation: two-axis scrolling now pans the canvas by default, while pinch and `Cmd/Ctrl+scroll` perform focal-point zoom; the legacy scroll-to-zoom profile remains available in Settings, preserving its direction and sensitivity.
- Introduced logical widget input ownership: widgets capture the wheel after an explicit click or a configurable hover delay, keep focus until you click outside, and offer `Off / On / Key` capture modes; a separate hold binding temporarily captures full canvas navigation, including drag.
- Preserved gesture continuity across native Browser surfaces: page-vs-canvas ownership latches for 250 ms of wheel inactivity, pinch and `Cmd/Ctrl+scroll` always zoom the canvas, and a focused Browser page keeps scrolling natively when capture is disabled.

## 1.2.1

- Plugin canvas apps now open and refocus at native `1.0` scale, avoiding fractional-scale blur; their transparent iframe backdrop also removes the bright seam around rounded plugin windows.
- Terminal and Browser semantic summaries now reserve width before counter-scaling and keep their content centered, preventing icons and text from being clipped at distant canvas zoom levels.

## 1.2.0

- Added native macOS window chrome: a hidden title bar with traffic-light buttons, a compact brand bar, and correct native-fullscreen behavior; Linux and Windows keep the existing custom frame.
- Added OS-encrypted plugin secrets via Electron safeStorage (fail-closed when no system keyring is available) with per-call permission checks, quotas, change events, and uninstall cleanup.
- Plugins can now contribute a settings entry opened in a sandboxed frame, declare minimum canvas sizes, and open another canvas of the same plugin beside the current one.
- Plugin HOME widgets are listed beside built-in widgets in Appearance → HOME composition and can be added or removed like built-in ones, closing the 1.1.0 known gap; Settings → Plugins is scoped back to install/uninstall only.
- Added optional plugin modules: install-time selection, per-file SHA-256 and byte-count verification, atomic reconfiguration with rollback, and module-derived permissions applied consistently to SDK authorization and the plugin resource CSP.
- Plugin storage change events are now broadcast from the main process, so canvases, HOME widgets, and separate windows of the same plugin observe each other's writes.
- Hardened plugin downloads: redirects are pinned to `api.github.com` and `raw.githubusercontent.com`, and module downloads reuse the 1.1.0 retry/backoff.
- Documented the optional-module trust model: file integrity is anchored to the plugin manifest fetched from GitHub over TLS without a separate signature.

Known issue: installed plugins cannot be updated in place yet — uninstall and reinstall to pick up a newer version. An update action is planned.

## 1.1.0

- Scaled native browser pages to the canvas zoom via Chromium zoom factor (clamped 0.5–3), so browser content follows the canvas scale at any zoom.
- Reported browser viewport bounds synchronously and kept the native view visible during canvas panning, dragging, and resizing; this fixes the 1.0.2 issue where the native browser view could cover a non-maximized window and block canvas controls.
- Focused the browser tab's web contents on canvas pointer-down, so typing reaches the page without an extra click.
- Added a Settings toggle for browser agent presence indicators (on by default): presence badges/cursors no longer appear at authentication, cursors render as plain dots without names, and only agents that actually used the browser are shown.
- Retried GitHub plugin downloads up to three times with backoff on transient failures (timeouts, connection errors, HTTP 408/429/5xx, interrupted streams).
- Added terminal session restart: a restart button on exited cards and a `Ctrl+D` shortcut; PageUp/PageDown now page the scrollback in the normal buffer, and the terminal cursor is a block.
- Enabled wheel zoom over applications by default.
- Synchronized documentation in English, Russian, and Simplified Chinese.

Known issue: HOME layout customization is not finished for external plugins — plugin tiles cannot yet be placed or rearranged in the HOME layout editor. This gap is tracked for future work; contributions are welcome.

## 1.0.2

- Exposed the built-in browser from HOME as a movable, resizable canvas application with trusted tabs/navigation, downloads, site dialogs, safe tab restore, browser-data clearing, semantic summaries, and stable native-view geometry during camera/card motion.
- Added scoped browser automation for CanvasTTY-launched Claude Code, Codex, and Kimi sessions through a bundled stdio MCP helper and authenticated current-user Unix socket or protected Windows named pipe; no TCP listener, remote-debugging port, arbitrary JavaScript, cookie/storage API, or raw CDP surface is exposed.
- Added connected-agent badges/cursors, per-agent activity isolation, revision-bound element refs, per-tab FIFO mutations, request deduplication, bounded concurrency/rate limits/timeouts, dialog/download handling, and redacted screenshots that fail closed when sensitive regions cannot be resolved.
- Added a persistent redacted browser audit hash chain below Electron `userData/browser/audit`, 100 MB rotation, 30-day rotated-file retention, integrity checks, and fail-closed agent mutations when the required pre-action audit cannot be written.
- Integrated browser cards with terminal-equivalent canvas selection, click/hover focus, empty-canvas clearing, window actions, wheel zoom over applications, and a stable renderer surface while the native view is repositioned.
- Hardened the Windows agent transport with a bundled native named-pipe host restricted to the exact current-user SID and added real Electron/provider smoke coverage across the release pipeline.
- Fixed the repository secret audit for linked Git worktrees by ignoring repository metadata entry names before file-type inspection while preserving personal-path detection in publishable files.
- Synchronized browser, security, local-data, audit-log, and release documentation in English, Russian, and Simplified Chinese.

Known issue: if the main CanvasTTY window did not start maximized, opening Browser can make the native browser view cover the window and leave the canvas controls unusable. For this prerelease, start CanvasTTY maximized before opening Browser; a fix is planned for the next patch.

## 1.0.1

- Added `Shift+Enter` terminal line breaks without submitting the current prompt.
- Fixed terminal selection and keyboard focus: selecting a live card routes typing into xterm, while pressing empty canvas clears the selection and focus outline.
- Added optional focus-on-hover with slow (`500ms`), normal (`250ms`), and fast (`80ms`) enter/leave delays. Programmatic hover focus no longer forwards focus-report sequences into agent TUIs or jumps their history.
- Added independent terminal-scroll and canvas-zoom wheel direction settings. Terminal scrolling defaults to wheel-down moving down; canvas zoom retains its previous direction.
- Batched PTY output into 16ms renderer updates and replaced repeated scrollback string copies with a bounded chunk buffer, eliminating high-volume terminal flicker and reducing history resets under large output bursts.
- Made settings, plugin-registry, and media-grant write queues recover after transient filesystem errors, and aligned provider-client metadata with the packaged app version.
- Added complete Simplified Chinese runtime-plugin documentation, synchronized terminal-control guidance across English, Russian, and Chinese, and documented local plugin/media/browser data.
- Added the MIT License and localized security, changelog, architecture, and UI-contract documents.

## 1.0.0

- Added a lightweight local startup page that appears before settings, plugins, media, and IPC services initialize; bootstrap failures now surface as a visible error page with a native-dialog fallback instead of a blank window.
- Added Electron single-instance lock: a second launch restores and focuses the existing window.
- Remapped terminal pointer coordinates from the canvas's CSS-transformed rectangle back to xterm layout coordinates, so text selection, mouse reporting (vim, tmux), and wheel scrolling work at any canvas zoom.
- Reworked terminal clipboard shortcuts: copy with `Ctrl+C` (with selection), `Ctrl+Shift+C`, or `Cmd+C`; paste with `Ctrl+Shift+V`, `Cmd+V`, or `Shift+Insert` through `Terminal.paste`; shortcuts now match physical keys and work on non-Latin keyboard layouts.
- Added a packaged-app smoke harness (`CANVASTTY_SMOKE_TEST=1` prints `CANVASTTY_SMOKE_READY` after first paint) and wired it into the Linux release pipeline under `xvfb-run` with FUSE2.

## 0.9.99 — public preview

- Added a permissioned runtime plugin registry for ready-to-run static GitHub repositories.
- Added manifest v1 contributions for sandboxed HOME widgets, movable canvas apps, and separate CanvasTTY-owned windows.
- Added plugin preview/permission review, enable/disable/uninstall controls, isolated storage, CSP-constrained assets, and a shared host SDK.
- Added persistent user-granted music libraries, seekable local audio streams, and bounded playlist read/write APIs for full player plugins.
- Added a sandboxed built-in browser core scaffold with tabs, navigation, a persistent isolated profile, and canvas-card geometry; it is intentionally not exposed from HOME yet.
- Replaced the fixed HOME composition with a spacious persisted 16 × 12 layout and visual drag/resize editor while preserving the approved default arrangement.
- Added any-edge window and HOME-widget resizing, visible edit-only HOME boundaries, out-of-bounds draft placement, save validation, and edit-mode isolation from other canvas windows.
- Added runtime-plugin architecture/authoring documentation and a complete Studio Kit example package.

## 0.9.2 — public preview

- Made provider CLI discovery cross-platform: per-user CLI directories are now resolved on both Linux and Windows, so AppImage and Windows launches find existing `codex`, `claude`, and `kimi` installs.

## 0.9.1 — public preview

- Restored provider CLI discovery for graphical AppImage launches by supplementing the desktop-session `PATH` with existing per-user CLI directories, including Kimi's `~/.kimi-code/bin`.
- Prevented late terminal input and resize events from crashing the Electron main process when they race with PTY exit (`EBADFD`).

## 0.9.0 — public preview

- Fixed the main window never appearing when the renderer paints before `loadURL` resolves; the `ready-to-show` listener is now attached before loading.
- Added RTS-style edge panning (off by default; enable in Settings): the camera drifts while the pointer rests near a viewport edge over empty canvas and pauses over interactive surfaces.
- Added Settings controls for edge panning (toggle and speed) and wheel zoom sensitivity.
- Reorganized Settings into General, Appearance, and Controls sections.
- Added explicit Off, Single click, and Double click modes for terminal focus/zoom; automatic click focus is off by default.
- Added remappable application shortcuts with `Home` for the Home zone and `F2` for inline terminal-window rename, plus an optional live shortcut hint.
- Preserved PTY state and scrollback while changing palettes, patterns, settings, and custom window titles.
- Improved terminal clipboard shortcuts, edge resizing, semantic-zoom interaction, and multilingual documentation.

## 0.8.2 — public preview

- Publish only end-user installers from release jobs, excluding unpacked build directories.
- Give Windows NSIS and portable executables distinct artifact names.

## 0.8.1 — public preview

- Made repository and documentation security checks portable across LF/CRLF checkouts and Windows drive paths.
- No application behavior changed from the `0.8.0` preview candidate.

## 0.8.0 — public preview

- Spatial canvas for live local PTY and AI-agent CLI sessions.
- Fixed Home zone with launchers, sessions, clock, media, and source-backed provider limits.
- Movable, resizable, snapping terminal cards with semantic zoom navigation.
- Electron process isolation with typed, allow-listed IPC and local-only settings.
- Multilingual repository entry points and documentation in English, Russian, and Simplified Chinese.
- Reproducible Linux, Windows, and macOS packaging through GitHub Actions.
- Repository secret audit and strict package-content allowlist.

Known preview constraints: runtime widget plugins are not implemented; Windows and macOS behavior still needs broader real-device validation; release packages are not code-signed or notarized.
