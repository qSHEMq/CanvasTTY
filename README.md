      CanvasTTY is an Electron spatial desktop for real local PTYs and AI-agent CLI sessions. Keep a fixed Home zone, arrange live terminals on an infinite canvas, and see provider limits backed by real data sources.

## Stack

| Desktop | Interface | Terminal | Providers |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Electron**<br>electron-vite | **React**<br>TypeScript | **xterm.js**<br>node-pty | **Codex**<br>Claude · Kimi · OpenCode · Hermes · Grok Build · OMP · Pi |

The application interface currently supports English and Russian. This documentation is also available in Simplified Chinese.

## One canvas, real sessions

Launch a shell or agent in a project directory, move and resize its live terminal, zoom out to navigate semantically, and return to Home for sessions, limits, media, and launch shortcuts. CanvasTTY keeps PTY state in the trusted main process and exposes only typed, allow-listed capabilities to the renderer.

## Windows shells and provider CLIs

On Windows, the Terminal launcher uses the built-in Windows PowerShell with a clean `-NoLogo -NoProfile` session, then falls back to `pwsh` or `cmd.exe`. Codex, Claude, Qwen Code, Kimi, OpenCode, Hermes, Grok Build, OMP, and Pi are resolved to a concrete `.exe`, `.com`, `.cmd`, or `.bat` launcher from the user's `PATH` or standard per-user CLI directories before they are passed to `node-pty`/ConPTY.

CanvasTTY does not install provider CLIs. If a provider is missing, the launch dialog reports which CLI was not found and which directories were checked. Install the required CLI and restart CanvasTTY so the desktop process receives the updated environment.

## Install

Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/howdeploy/CanvasTTY/releases): AppImage/deb for Linux x86_64, installer/portable app for Windows x64, and dmg/zip for Apple Silicon macOS. macOS bundles are ad-hoc signed and verified but do not have a Developer ID signature or Apple notarization; Windows packages remain unsigned. Intel Mac builds are not included yet. Read [installing and local-data security](docs/installing-and-security.md).

Or run from source:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Runtime plugins

CanvasTTY includes a permissioned runtime for ready-to-run static GitHub packages: HOME widgets, canvas apps, and separate sandboxed windows. The host SDK now supports persistent user-selected music-library grants, seekable local audio streams, and bounded playlist import/export for full player plugins. See the [authoring and security guide](docs/plugins.md), [manifest schema](docs/canvastty-plugin.schema.json), and [TypeScript SDK declarations](docs/plugin-api.d.ts).

Plugin examples:

- [canvastty-plugin-hermes-hud](https://github.com/howdeploy/canvastty-plugin-hermes-hud) — from the CanvasTTY author: a HOME widget that starts and stops an installed Hermes Desktop in HUD mode and shows the confirmed live process state; it uses only the narrow `hermes:hud` permission.
- [canvastty-music](https://github.com/Alitryel/canvastty-music) — by [@Alitryel](https://github.com/Alitryel): a compact player for local audio folders and Yandex Music with a separate full-size library workspace, playlists, queues, and an optional animated pet.
- [canvastty-plugin-hermes-dashboard](https://github.com/4444cjtr/canvastty-plugin-hermes-dashboard) — by [@4444cjtr](https://github.com/4444cjtr): a HOME widget that checks whether the local Hermes Agent dashboard is running, starts it through a small loopback helper, and opens it inside CanvasTTY as an embedded browser card.

## Built-in agent browser

CanvasTTY includes a core browser rather than a plugin capability: trusted React chrome backed by sandboxed Electron `WebContentsView` tabs in one persistent Chromium profile. It is available from HOME, restores safe HTTP(S) tabs, keeps website credentials inside Chromium, manages downloads/uploads, and exposes typed browser actions to Claude Code, Codex, Kimi, OpenCode, and Hermes sessions launched by CanvasTTY.

The browser card participates in the same canvas selection, hover-focus, drag, resize, and semantic-zoom model as terminals. Settings controls agent access, tab restore, recent downloads/activity, and browser-data clearing. Agent access uses an authenticated local socket or named pipe and a bundled stdio MCP helper; it does not open a TCP or remote-debugging port and never exports cookies, passwords, auth headers, local storage, arbitrary JavaScript, or raw CDP.

Every browser command produces a redacted local activity record. Persistent JSONL audit files form a hash chain below Electron `userData/browser/audit`, rotate at 100 MB, and prune rotated files older than 30 days during store initialization or rotation. Typed/page text, screenshots, credentials, URL queries/fragments, headers, cookies, and tokens are not stored. See the [browser and audit-log guide](docs/browser.md) and [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
